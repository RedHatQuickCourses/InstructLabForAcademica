You can contribute to the taxonomy in the following two ways:

**Adding new examples to existing leaf nodes:**

Go to the corresponding leaf node / end of the branch and modify the YAML
Add a new example to the qna.yaml files as a new entry to the list

**Adding new branches/skills corresponding to the existing domain:**

You can add new folders under the corresponding category (replace any spaces with underscores _)
Create a new qna.yaml file containing examples for the new skill
