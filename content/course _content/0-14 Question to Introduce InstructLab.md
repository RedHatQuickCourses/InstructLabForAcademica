# Question!
    
- ### Have you experienced a Large Language Model (LLM) make some thing up - where the LLM got it wrong and perhaps hallucinated?



- ### Have you been unalbe to find infomration that you were looking for in an LLM - did it had a gap in its knowledge?

---



One of the key challenges with large language models (LLMs) is that they start to become outdated almost immediately after deployment. The world evolves quickly, new information emerges constantly.  While the model's knowledge remains frozen at the point of its last update, unless it's connected to external data sources.

Some approaches help address this issue. For example, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows models to stay relatively up to date by dynamically pulling in new information. Similarly, agentic, agent-based systems can enhance an LLM's capabilities, for example, if you ask ChatGPT about todays current affairs in the news it will access the internet in real time to retrieve the latest facts, rather than halucinating and making information up as it does not have the information.

However, these methods are limited to publicly available data. This is a significant constraint, especially considering that businesses increasingly want to use LLMs while roughly 90% of their useful data is private and stored internally. The core challenge, then, becomes: **How can we effectively and securely integrate private, internal data into an LLM environment?**
