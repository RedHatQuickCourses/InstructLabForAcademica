# Advantages of Synthetic Data Generation


**Pro's of using InstructLab to generate Synthetic Data are:** 
- it fills knowledge gaps in LLMs
- it can help boosting performance and reducing bias 
- you control the quality of your training data (qna/Context/Knowledge) 
- organisations or niche topics, may **not** have vast quantities of content so generating synthetic data can scale up and enhance for training purposes
- generating synthetic data with InstructLab is easy, fast, and has a lower cost than creating this manually through human creation.
- customisable for specific scenarios
- you can create information dense content which fits with the InstructLab taxonomy
divided into specific branches and leave

**Potential Con's:**
Since the data is synthetically generated by LLMs, hallucinations are possible, however, as InstructLab provides a Critic Model, and you can perform manual verification prior to training
