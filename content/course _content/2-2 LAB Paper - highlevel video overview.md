IBM and Red Hat\'s new open source project is designed to lower the cost of customizing Language Models by allowing end users, subject matter experts, and enterprises to collaboratively add new knowledge and skills to AI language models which democratize AI building for everyone.

\"Instead of having a large company decide what your model knows, and what it can do, InstructLab lets you dictate through its taxonomy what knowledge and skills your model should have\" Akash Srivastava, the IBM researcher who led the team that developed LAB Method and is now principal AI product advisor at Red Hat.
