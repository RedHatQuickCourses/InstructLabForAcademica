## InstructLab does not require you to be:
- **Data Scientist**
- **Able to write code such as python or other languages**

## :bulb:You need to be
- **Knowledgeable about the knowledge or skills you are adding to the LLM/SLM**
- **Computer literate**
- **Able to create an account in GitHub public organisation to access the InstructLab GUI**


## :bulb:InstructLab is:
- **Either GUI based or driven through a terminal window - Having the GUI means anyone can contribute knowledge without familiarity, of YAML, GitHub, Machine Learning, or coding!**
