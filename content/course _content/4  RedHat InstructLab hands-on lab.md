# RedHat InstructLab Hands on Lab 

- :bulb:In this lab we will used the Command Line Interface (CLI) to setup InstructLab, ask questions of the Quantised LLM, to generate Synthetically Generated Data, so we can customize our model. 

- :bulb:When working in the CLI you will normally use a tool such as Visual Studio to create the files used in InstructLab.  If you have issues with the YAML as the formating is very specific, then you can always use the InstructLab GUI to make this easier. **In this lab the files have all been created for you in the correct format.**
